 * Description: Calculates all-pairs shortest path in a directed graph that might have negative edge weights.
 * Input is an distance matrix $m$, where $m[i][j] = \texttt{inf}$ if $i$ and $j$ are not adjacent.
 * As output, $m[i][j]$ is set to the shortest distance between $i$ and $j$, \texttt{inf} if no path, or \texttt{-inf} if the path goes through a negative-weight cycle.
 * Time: O(N^3)
 * Status: stress-tested
